# {{PACKAGE_NAME}}

A new npm package generated by TWS CLI.

## Getting Started

This package has been scaffolded with:
- Git repository initialized with remote origin set to https://github.com/{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}/{{PACKAGE_NAME}}.git
- TypeScript configuration
- Vitest for testing
- Prettier for code formatting
- Changesets for version management
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD

## Development Workflow

### 1. **Development Phase**
- Write new code in utils.ts
- Write tests in utils.test.ts

### 2. **Testing & Quality**
- `npm run dev` - Run tests in watch mode during development
- `npm run test` - Run all tests once
- `npm run ci` - Full CI check (build + format check + tests)

### 3. **Document Changes**
- `npm run changeset` - Create a changeset describing your changes
  - This will prompt you to select the type of change (patch/minor/major)
  - Write a description of what changed

### 4. **Format & Build**
- `npm run format` - Auto-format your code with Prettier
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to dist

### 5. **Release**
- `npm run release` - This will:
  - Update version numbers based on changesets
  - Generate/update CHANGELOG.md
  - Publish to npm

### 6. **Pre-publish Safety**
- The `prepublishOnly` script automatically runs your CI checks before any publish

**Key Commands for Your Workflow:**
- `npm run changeset` - Document what you changed
- `npm run ci` - Verify everything is ready
- `npm run release` - Version and publish

This setup with Changesets is excellent because it:
- Enforces semantic versioning
- Automatically generates changelogs
- Handles monorepo scenarios well
- Provides a clear audit trail of changes

## Publishing

To publish this package to npm, make sure you have an npm account and are logged in.

```sh
npm publish --access public
```

Or push to main to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Repository Setup

The git remote origin has been automatically configured. To create the GitHub repository, run:

```sh
gh repo create {{GITHUB_USERNAME}}/{{PACKAGE_NAME}} --public --push
```
